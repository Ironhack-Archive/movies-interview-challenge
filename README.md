Your application should have the following **features**:
1. Users should be able to **add new movies**.
2. Users should be able to **see the list of 20 most recent movies**.
  (_BONUS_ points for implementing pagination)
3. Users should be able to **see the details of a movie**.
4. Users should be able to **update existing movies**.
5. Users should be able to **delete movies**.
