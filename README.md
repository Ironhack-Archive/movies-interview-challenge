# LT Interview Challenge | Movies App 

## Goals
1. Apply technologies of the **MERN stack**. (Redux/Context is not mandatory.)
2. Demonstrate an overall grasp of Web development fundamentals.
3. Talk about your code during the code review.

## Submission
Push your code to a public repository on your GitHub account and send its URL via email. We'll check the code quality and reach out to schedule your code review.

## Introduction
You are the CTO of a small disruptive startup in stealth mode with a single objective: to take down IMDB. You're hoping that your first technology decision will be an impactful one: **your application will use JavaScript everywhere**! JavaScript is on the rise, so what can go wrong?

## Technologies

Your goal is to create your prototype: a simple full-stack CRUD application for movies.
To do this, you need to:
- Use **NodeJS and ExpressJS**.
  (_BONUS_ points for following REST naming conventions in your URLs)
- Use **your choice of database**.
  (_BONUS_ points for using MongoDB)
- Use **ReactJS** in the frontend
- Apply **basic CSS styling**. (No page should look unstyled. Feel free to use a CSS component library like Bootstrap or Materialize or any other.)
- Show **validation feedback** when a form is submitted incorrectly.

## Features

Your application should have the following **features**:
1. You should have registered users:
    - they will use email and password to authenticate themselves,
    - they will have to input their full name when signing in.
    - _BONUS_ - feel free to use any of the social strategies to authenticate users.
2. Users should be able to **add/create new movies**.
3. Users should be able to **see the list of 20 most recent movies**.
  (_BONUS_ points for implementing pagination)
3. Users should be able to **see the details page of each movie**.
4. Users should be able to **update existing movies**.
5. Users should be able to **delete movies**.

To summarize:

The **schema for a user** should include:
- full name
- email
- password

The **schema for a movie** should include:
- title
- poster image URL (_BONUS_ points for allowing image file uploads)
- director
- release date
- score (1 to 10)
- plot description
